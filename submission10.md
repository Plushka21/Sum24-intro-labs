### Task 1. Artifact Registries Research

1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is one of the leading cloud service providers that provides a wide range of services for computing, storage, databases, machine learning, analytics, *etc*. As main fetures AWS offers 
    - variety of services and solutions,
    - extensive network of data centers worldwide,
    - high scalability.

    However, all these features come with a high price and complexity of managing and configuration due to the large number of services.

    As artifact registry AWS provies ***Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)*** that has
    - fully managed Docker container registry,
    - integrated Identity and Access Management (IAM) for security,
    - support for public and private repositories,
    - sclability and high availability.


2. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** is suite of cloud computing services that provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics, and machine learning, alongside a set of management tools. Main features that GCP provides are
    - strong offerings for big data and machine learning,
    - high-performance global network,
    - smaller prices,
    - simple integration with other Google products.
    
    However, GCP offers fewer services compared to AWS and has smaller ecosystem of third-party tools and services.

    GCP also has artifact registry ***Google Artifact Registry*** which main features are
    - unified repository for container images and other artifacts.
    - support of Docker, Maven, npm, and other formats.
    - integration with Google Cloudâ€™s security and IAM policies.
    - scalable and reliable storage.

3. **Azure (Microsoft Azure)** is the cloud computing platform developed by Microsoft. It offers management, access and development of applications and services to individuals, companies, and governments through its global infrastructure. Azure as well has its own features:
    - convenient integration with Microsoft products and services,
    - support for hybrid cloud environments,
    - large number of data centers worldwide,
    - comprehensive suite of AI and ML services,
    - extensive compliance certifications and strong security features.

    However, just as with AWS, offered services have high price and it may be complex to manage everything.


    Regarding artifact registry Azure has ***Azure Container Registry (ACR)*** which main features are
    - managed Docker container registry service,
    - integrated with Azure Active Directory for security,
    - supports geo-replication for high availability,
    - automated container building and patching.
